> "What is this Git thing all about ..?"

## Git?
[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a version control system (VCS), which allows you to keep track of changes in files. It also coordinates the files and their changes among multiple people - a project team for example - or simply for yourself. Have a look at the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (Chacon and Straub, 2014) book to lift the lid on Git features.

Git is [widely used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) in industry as a VCS, and as such can be an essential skill to learn as part of your University studies. Many [existing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Graphical-Interfaces) coding tools have built-in Git extensions - including Visual Studio. These allow you to easily link your code project, Git and your chosen IDE.

Within Git, the files for each project that you create are collected together in a repository, or 'repo'. On your local computer, the project will contain a ```.git/``` folder containing all the information related to the files in the project, any changes over time, etc. If you delete this folder, your project is no longer considered a Git repo on your local computer.

## Getting Started
If you haven't already, download and install Git for your OS from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/).

You can create a repo and interact with Git in a number of ways - through an IDE such as Visual Studio, or manually.
